This repository implements the Global Matching Model (GMM) from Osth & Dennis (2015) to explore the test position effect in recognition memory.

<b>File Descriptions</b>
<ul><li>runme.R – Runs model simulations. This is the main script to generate predictions. You can set parameter values and task design features here (e.g., list length, task type).
<li>model.R – Computes the means and variances of the old and new item distributions based on item- and context-level match/mismatch.
<li>tpe.R – Estimates changes in accuracy over the course of testing (i.e., the test position effect) for yes-no recognition and alternative forced-choice tasks.</ul>

<b>Getting Started</b>
<br>To generate predictions, run the runme.R script after adjusting the parameters and task design as needed.</br>
<br>For theoretical background on the model, please refer to:
<ul>Osth & Dennis (2015). Psychological Review.</ul>
